**Ingredients:**

2 sticks (8 oz) 'cold and cubed' unsalted butter

½ cup (100 grams) granulated sugar

1 cup (220 grams) light brown sugar

½ cup (110grams ) dark brown sugar

2 eggs

3 cups (384 grams) All-Purpose flour

1 teaspoon table or fine sea salt

1 teaspoon baking powder

¼ tsp baking soda

¾ cup Guittard semisweet chocolate chips\
¾ cup Guittard milk chocolate chips



**Directions:**

If you can, weigh ingredients rather than using measuring cups. I always freeze these cookies after forming them so that I can have a fresh, warm cookie whenever I want!

1. In bowl of electric mixer fitted with paddle, cream together butter and sugars until well blended and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time.. and beat for up to 10 mins. You're looking for the cream and sugar to emulsify, and the mixture to turn a light brown. The individual sugar granules should be well incorporated, and when you taste the mixture it shouldn't be very grainy from the sugars.

2. Keep the mixer running on low and slowly add flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder and mix until just combined.3. Gently fold in chocolate chips. Do not over mix.

4. Refrigerate dough for 4-24 hours before baking. If you would like to freeze the dough so that you can save it, put it in the fridge for 2 hours, then form the cookies. Place the cookies on a sheet pan and let them sit in the fridge for another 2 - 3 hours to harden up. You can then put the cookies in a freezer bag and transfer to the freezer.

5. To bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

6. You can divide cookies into 12 equal portions or 24 equal portions, For 12 large cookies, they will be about 4 oz each. For 24 cookies, around 2 oz will work. For crispier edges, make cookies square, not round.

7. If cooking on sheet pan: Place each cookies on sheet pan lined with parchment paper. You have the option to add the chopped chocolate pieces into dough by hand. Bake in the preheated oven 15-20 minutes depending on how gooey and raw you like the interior, until very lightly browned, taking care not to over bake. When making smaller cookies, check the cookie at the 12 minute mark. You should see some golden brown just at the bottom edge of the cookie, and when you lightly press in the middle of the cookie, it should slowly spring back up. Taking the cookies out before they are totally done will allow them to finish cooking outside the oven and remain chewier in the center.

8. If cooking in a cast iron: Get a small cast iron pan (5 inches max), and place a single cookie in the pan. Put in oven and cook for 18 - 22 minutes, following the same guidelines above to check if the cookie is done.

9. Sprinkle with vanilla sea salt or regular sea salt and Let cool on rack. Store what you don't immediately eat in an airtight container.

10. If cooking from the freezer: Preheat oven to 350 F and place cookies on sheet pan or cast iron directly from the freezer, following step 7 or 8 depending on cooking method. You will probably need to increase baking time by 2 or 3 minutes.
