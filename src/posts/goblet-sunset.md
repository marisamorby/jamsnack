*from Kristy Marcinova*

More of a liquid treat, but thought I'd share a fun little cocktail I made. Incidentally, I was clearing out some stuff in my fridge and ended up making a neat concoction!

Unfortunately, I don't know the *exact* specs of this, as I was kind of winging it, but below are my recommended amounts. Feel free to take liberties and experiment based on your own tastes and preferences!

The idea was to pair the bittersweet citrus notes of the vermouth and make something refreshing.

## Ingredients

* 2 parts Martini Fiero Vermouth
* 1¬Ω parts blood orange juice
* gin
* ice

## Notes

This is a relatively easy concoction to make! Therefore, you don't need to build this in a shaker, instead you can do so in the glass directly. To make the layered effect, you'll need a spoon to pour the liquids over it.

Also, if you don't have the specific [Martini Fiero](https://www.martini.com/products/martini-fiero/) handy, I recommend trying it with a vermouth of your choice and combining it with a bitter like Aperol or Campari, half and half.

For the gin, I used [Blood Monkey](http://bloodmonkeygin.com/). I literally just added a little on top to fill the glass, as it complimented the taste and I didn't want to overpower the rest of the ingredients with booziness.

## Directions

1. Put a nice block of ice into your glassware of choice ‚Äî either a goblet (pictured) or a tumbler (old fashioned glass).
2. Add the vermouth into the glass.
3. Pour the blood orange juice over a bar spoon, to create the layered effect.
4. Top up with gin, again using the bar spoon to maintain the layers.

Enjoy! üçπ
