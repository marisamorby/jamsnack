*from Bhavana Srinivas*

**Ingredients:**

**Vegetables:**

1 red onion, thinly sliced

3 green chillies, finely chopped

4 garlic cloves, finely chopped

2 tomatoes or 300 ml tomato puree

1 green capsicum, thinly sliced

1 lime

Cheddar/Mozzarella Cheese

**Masalas:**

Salt, to taste

Garam masala, 1 teaspoon

**Other:**

Naan, store bought or home made

Paneer, store bought or home made, how much ever you prefer :D

**Directions:**

Saute the onion till soft and caramelized, around 10 minutes. 

Once onions are cooked, add garlic and chillis. You can reduce the amount of chillis if you want lesser spice. Add the salt now, this aids in cooking the onions/garlic faster. 

After 5 minutes, add the tomatoes and cook till the tomatoes are all mush. IF you are using tomato puree like I did, just add that and cook it for another 8 minutes till all the raw smell goes away. 

Once this is done, add the garam masala and mix into the onion/tomatoes. 

Finally, add the paneer and sliced capsicum. We add this at the end so that the capsicum can remain crunchy. We don't want to overcook it. 

Cook this for 2 minutes. Keep this aside.

**Preparing the base:**

Preheat the oven to 425 degree F. 

Heat the naan for 8 minutes - this will make the base crisp and crunchy. 

Once this is done, add the above prepared masala on top of the naan and evenly spread it. Top it off with desired amounts of grated cheddar/mozzarella cheese - the more the better :P 

Put it back in the oven for 5 more minutes. AAAAAND DONE. 

Enjoy with a glass of wine/beer/water or any other liquid.
